## Installation

```python
	pip install okta_jwt
```

### Usage

To generate a token, you need to pass in `issuer`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `username` and `password` as parameters
```python
	>>> from okta_jwt.jwt import generate_token
	>>> generate_token(issuer, client_id, client_secret, username, password)
```

This generates and returns Okta Access Token.

PS: You can also configure additional parameters such as the `scope` and `grant_type`.

\
To Validate the Access Token, you need to pass in the `access_token`, `issuer`, `audience` and `client_ids` as parameters. You can pass in multiple Client IDs
```python
	>>> from okta_jwt.jwt import validate_token
	>>> validate_token(access_token, issuer, audience, client_ids)
```

If the token is valid then it will return the payload.


## Running the tests

### Break down into tests
